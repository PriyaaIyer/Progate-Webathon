                    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

                    <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
                    <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
                    <li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
                    <li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
                    <li>HTML elements are represented by tags</li>
                    HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
                    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
                </ul>

                        <center>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
                            colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
                            flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
                            multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                            file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

                            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page
                            in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
                            (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also
                            has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
                            applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
                            is predictable.</center>

                        <center>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
                            Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
                            applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all
                            major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

                            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
                            programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
                            dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                            However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
                            storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides
                            those APIs.

                            Originally used only in web browsers, JavaScript engines are also now embedded in
                            server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.

                            Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name,
                            syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly
                            in design.</center>
